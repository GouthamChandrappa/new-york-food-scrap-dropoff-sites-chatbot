    "\n",
    "For this custom chatbot project, I have selected the NYC Food Scrap Drop-off Sites dataset. This dataset includes comprehensive details about food scrap drop-off sites in New York City, such as locations, operating hours, and other pertinent information. With a minimum of 20 rows of text data, it is well-suited for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom chatbot will be developed to provide users with accurate and current information regarding food scrap drop-off sites in New York City. This will be particularly useful for individuals interested in composting and supporting a more sustainable urban environment. Leveraging this dataset, the chatbot will be able to answer questions about site locations, hours of operation, and other relevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This customization will benefit NYC residents and businesses seeking to responsibly dispose of their food scraps, as well as tourists who wish to maintain eco-friendly practices during their visit. By offering precise and helpful information on food scrap drop-off sites, the chatbot can assist users in adopting sustainable habits and contribute to reducing overall waste in New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, by providing this service, the chatbot promotes a culture of caring and environmental stewardship among its users. It encourages individuals to make conscious, eco-friendly decisions and fosters a community spirit centered on sustainability and responsibility. Through this initiative, the chatbot not only aids in practical waste disposal but also inspires a deeper commitment to caring for our planet."
